Getting Started
-------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** - Windows is slightly unsupported.
 - **Python, version 2.7** - 'sudo apt-get install python2.7'
 - **Pip** - If Python is already installed, but the 'pip' command doesn't work, just run 'sudo easy_install pip'

### Getting Set Up
1. Make your branch on GitHub if you haven't.
2. Clone your branch to your account using 'git clone -b BRANCHNAME git@github.com:byutopia/Capstone.git' or 'git clone -b BRANCHNAME https://github.com/byutopia/Capstone.git' if you are SSH-ed.
3. 'cd Capstone'
4. Install Flask and the necessary requirements by using the command, 'sudo pip install -r requirements.txt'
5. Run the app using './utopia.py' or 'python utopia.py'
6. If the app builds successfully, navigate to the host's IP 192.168.101.39:8080 or its localhost:8080 to view the page.
