<p align="center"> Utopia Smart City Console is a Flask-operated app that interfaces with smart IoT devices to provide a proof of concept of a smart-city in action. </p>

Getting Started
-------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** - Windows is slightly unsupported.
 - **Python, version 2.7** - `sudo apt-get install python2.7`
 - **Pip** - If Python is already installed, but the 'pip' command doesn't work, just run `sudo easy_install pip`

### Getting Set Up
1. Make your branch on GitHub if you haven't. You can do so by navigating to the git and using the branch dropdown menu.

</p>
2. Clone your branch to your account using

```
git clone -b BRANCHNAME git@github.com:byutopia/Capstone.git OR git clone -b BRANCHNAME https://github.com/byutopia/Capstone.git
```
3. `cd Capstone`
4. Install Flask and the necessary requirements by using the command, `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the app using `./utopia.py` or `python utopia.py`
6. If the app builds successfully, navigate to 0.0.0.0:8080 to view the page.  

### Troubleshooting
If pip fails to install the dependencies on the package mysqlclient because `EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found`, run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev
```

This will install the MariaDB equivalent of the mysql\_config command, which is required for the Python package.
